```bash
# Requirements:
- Google Play Developer Account ($25 one-time fee)
- Google Play Console access

# MAJOR (1.x.x): Breaking changes, major new features
# MINOR (x.2.x): New features, backwards compatible  
# PATCH (x.x.3): Bug fixes, small improvements

# For mobile apps also increment build numbers:
# Android: versionCode (integer, always increment)
# iOS: CFBundleVersion (integer, always increment)
```

### Release Workflow
```bash
# 1. Development phase
git checkout develop
# ... develop features

# 2. Release preparation  
git checkout -b release/v1.2.0
# Update version numbers in:
# - packages/app/package.json
# - packages/app/android/app/build.gradle (versionCode & versionName)
# - packages/app/ios/Vyeya/Info.plist (CFBundleVersion & CFBundleShortVersionString)

# 3. QA testing
git push origin release/v1.2.0
# CI/CD deploys to QA environment and builds test apps

# 4. Production release
git checkout main
git merge release/v1.2.0
git tag v1.2.0
git push origin main --tags
# CI/CD builds production-signed apps
```

## üîí Security & Compliance

### App Security Checklist
