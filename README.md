# Vyeya - Direct Producer-to-Consumer Marketplace

Vyeya is a native mobile app (iOS and Android) connecting local produce growers directly with consumers, eliminating middlemen and ensuring fair prices. Whether you're a farmer, backyard gardener, or small-scale grower, this platform empowers you to sell your fresh produce directly to your community while providing consumers with fresh, affordable local products.

## Project Overview

This repository contains the source code for the Vyeya mobile application and its backend services. It is structured as a monorepo using [pnpm workspaces](https://pnpm.io/workspaces).

-   **`packages/app`**: The React Native mobile application for growers and consumers.
-   **`packages/server`**: The Node.js backend server powered by Express.js.
-   **`packages/shared`**: Shared code, primarily TypeScript types and interfaces, used across the app and server.

## Tech Stack

-   **Frontend**: React Native with TypeScript, Tailwind RN for styling, React Navigation
-   **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js, TypeScript
